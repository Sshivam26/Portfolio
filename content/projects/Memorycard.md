The memory card game, built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, challenges players to match pairs of cards from a shuffled deck. The game features a clean, responsive design and interactive gameplay, with cards flipping over to reveal their values. Players aim to find matching pairs while tracking their moves and time for a competitive experience.
